1. Running BABLS, CCLS_WSC, GA_WSC, LS_WSC as:

./solver_name example.wcol 1 300

"example.wcol" is an example graph.
"1" is the random seed.
"300" is the limit time(s).

The output format is that:
file_name << seed << best_result << best_time




2.Running GREEDY as:

./GREEDY example.wcol

"example.wcol" is an example graph.

The output format is that:
file_name << best_result << best_time
